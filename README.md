# OpenMP Educational Programs

This repository hosts a collection of OpenMP programs written in C, **developed by Hadbi Aghiles**.  
These programs are designed to illustrate fundamental concepts of parallel programming and provide practical examples for learning and experimentation.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Parallel regions and thread management
- Work-sharing constructs (`for`, `sections`)
- Synchronization mechanisms (`critical`, `atomic`, `barrier`)
- Reduction operations and shared data handling

## Repository Structure

Each program resides in its own folder under `src/` and includes a dedicated README with instructions for compilation and execution.
