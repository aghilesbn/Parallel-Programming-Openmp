# OpenMP Programs

This repository contains a collection of educational OpenMP programs written in C.

The goal of this project is to learn and demonstrate basic parallel programming concepts such as:

- Parallel regions and threads
- Work-sharing constructs (for, sections)
- Synchronization (critical, atomic, barriers)
- Reduction operations

Each program is placed in its own folder under `src/` and comes with a dedicated README file explaining how to compile and run it.

## Requirements

- A C compiler with OpenMP support (gcc recommended)
- OpenMP enabled in your compiler (`-fopenmp` flag for gcc)

## Compile and Run

See the README file inside each program folder for specific instructions.
